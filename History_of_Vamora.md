# Age of the Dark Sun
_When moonlight is all that's left to guide us,<br>
>We hold the line and sing her name<br>
>Until dawn's return and shadow's flight,<br>
>Kaguya's hope remains._<br>
>—Kaguya's Song, Songs of Lightless Vol. III

Long before the rise of nations or written history, the continent was ruled by the ancient Elven kingdoms. This age ended with the catastrophe known as the Dark Sun.
During this time, the sun vanished, and the balance of the world was broken. Orcish legions, driven by a mysterious force, surged from the Far Realms, burning forests and toppling Elven cities.

In the midst of this darkness, Princess Kaguya, the Moon-blessed daughter of Selûne, united the Elven peoples and led a legendary alliance to stand against the orcish invaders. Through her sacrifice, she defeated the Orcish warlord and ended the curse. The moon returned, and the sun was reborn as the goddess Solâna.

# Age of the Empire

> _"All banners bowed before the Empire. In unity, all differences faded—but even the brightest marble cracks when the heart beneath it grows hollow."_ <br>
> — Excerpt from  the Diary of Lord Nimblefoot<br>
> Halfling Lord who joined the Empire during it's golden age.

After the darkness lifted, the Elven kingdoms united their wisdom and magic to found a continent-spanning empire. Guided by self-exceptionalism and their closeness to the divine, the Elves believed themselves destined to rule and perfect the world.

The Blood War with the orcs continued to smolder along the empire's borders, a living reminder of old betrayals rooted in the Dark Sun. Though the empire pressed ever outward, these wounds never fully healed.

During this era, Elven explorers discovered scattered Human villages along the coasts—humble communities clinging to survival. The empire swiftly integrated these humans, often erasing their histories, languages, and customs in favor of a unified imperial identity under elven superiority.

As the Elven Empire expanded across the continent, it founded great cities and consolidated its power through knowledge and tradition. The prestigious Arcane Academy was established as the center for magical education and scholarship, training generations of mages, sages, and court advisors who would serve the empire's rulers.

It was the Elves who first mapped and claimed Vamora, the fertile continent that would one day shape the world's destiny. For centuries, Vamora flourished as elven imperial provinces, its culture and identity remade in the image of its Elven overseers.

The Age of the Empire ended with the death of the last Elven Emperor, who left no male heir. With the throne empty, the great houses of the Elves fell to rivalry and discord, and the unity of the empire began to unravel.

# Age of Vamora
## Before the Revolt
>_Great Spirits, <br>
>We thank you for the Third Gon-Vox who led us to these lands. <br>
>Guide us now as we wait For the Fourth, <br>
>Who will lead us to glory.<br>
>We listen for your call._<br>
>—Vamorian Uruk Prayer

For centuries after its discovery, Vamora was claimed by the distant Elven Empire. Elven colonists, administrators, and soldiers from the Old Land established cities and estates across the coasts and heartlands, imposing Elven law and culture on all who dwelled in their domains. The Elves saw Vamora as a land of endless potential—a canvas upon which they could remake the world in their own image, far from the old wars and rivalries.

Yet not all peoples of Vamora bent to Elven rule. The Orcs, led by their Gon-Vox ("The Voice")—a prophetic leader guided by the spirits—came to Vamora of their own accord, seeking new lands and new destinies. Following Sehzade Sultan Kulumar, son of Sultan Sulumar and leader of the Uruk, bands of orcish settlers journeyed across the sea, believing they answered a sacred calling. These Uruks and their followers established their own communities, living by their own customs and laws, ever watchful for the next Gon-Vox to guide their path.

Meanwhile, human and other non-elven populations within the Elven domains lived as subjects—often stripped of ancestral identities and shaped to fit the imperial ideal. Most toiled as laborers, servants, or farmers, with only a privileged few educated in elven ways.

Vamora, on the eve of revolution, was a continent of grand cities, distant estates, free orcish camps, and hidden tensions—orderly on the surface, yet alive with many voices and a longing for change.

## The Revolt under Aurum I, the Warrior

> _To the kingdoms of the Old Land, <br>
> Let it be known that Vamora stands free and unbroken. <br>
> No longer shall our fate be written by distant hands or old arrogance. <br>
> We claim our own dawn—by right, by struggle, and by the will of those who would be ruled no more._ <br>
> —The Declaration of Bastion, by Aurum I, First Crown of Bastion

The peace of Elven rule in Vamora would not last forever. Discontent simmered among the human population—stripped of their heritage, burdened with labor, and denied power by imperial decree. In the shadows and among the fields, talk of resistance began to grow.

It was during this time that a human leader, Aurum I, emerged. Charismatic and resolute, Aurum united scattered bands of rebels, outlaws, and oppressed villagers into a single cause. He called for an end to Elven domination and the restoration of freedom and dignity to the peoples of Vamora.

As the human uprising ignited, the Orcs saw an opportunity. Seizing the moment, orcish warbands launched their own campaign and captured the Goldleaf territories east of what is now Bastion—lands that had long been the domain of the Elven House Goldleaf. Aurum I, forced to secure his flank, fought a bitter campaign against the orcs before turning his attention westward to capture the remaining Elven strongholds and consolidate his new realm.

The Elven Empire, weakened by internal rivalries and distant from its Old Land heart, could not contain the revolt. Battles raged from city to countryside as Elven power crumbled and new alliances were forged.

With victory came the founding of a new human-led kingdom. Aurum I was crowned the first Crown of Vamora, and the capital city of Bastion was raised as a symbol of unity and newfound strength.

## The Reign of Ferrum II, the Builder

> _You have my gratitude for your steadfast service.<br>
> The roads and markets binding our kingdom are the fruit of your industry as much as royal vision. <br>
>As Vamora looks outward to new frontiers, I trust the Trading Company will remain our shield and standard-bearer.<br>
>Let our partnership endure, for in shared purpose lies our strength. <br>
>May fortune favor your banners._<br>
>—Excerpt from a Letter by Ferrum II, to the Directors of the Vamorian Trading Company

Following the turbulent victories of Aurum I, the newly forged Kingdom of Vamora entered an era of consolidation and challenge Ferrum II, Aurum's first born, inherited a realm still scarred by conflict and uneasy peace.

Ferrum II sought to solidify human rule and bring order to the land, expanding and strengthening the borders. His reign, however, was marked by persistent unrest. Tensions with the Orcish territories remained high, as old grievances from the wars lingered and new disputes over land and resources erupted. Ferrum II's campaigns against the orcish enclaves in the east were fierce and costly, deepening the divide between the two peoples even as some efforts at negotiation were made. Though eventually the campaign was fruitful, and the Goldleaf lands that the orcs took from his father's kingdom, returned to Human hands under the Westfold state.

Meanwhile, the Elven houses—diminished but not destroyed—attempted to reclaim influence in the new kingdom, sometimes as advisors, sometimes as conspirators. Ferrum II's administration walked a fine line between integration and suspicion, wary of both elven intrigue and orcish reprisal.

Despite these challenges, Ferrum II presided over the rebuilding of Bastion and the beginnings of a new Vamorian identity. The seeds of unity and ambition were sown, though the old wounds of conquest and rebellion had yet to truly heal.

## The Reign of Argenta, the Prosperous

>_Today, in the halls of Cerilia, we open more than doors to a college—we open a new chapter for all Vamora.<br>
> The discovery of mana marks not just a gift for scholars or mages, but a promise to every craftsman, farmer, and child in our land. Here, with our friends and kin from Eastwoods and beyond, let us shape wonders from wisdom, and forge a future that honors both tradition and invention. <br>
>May this place stand as proof that what unites us—craft, ingenuity, and the tireless work of many hands—will always outshine what divides us._ <br>
>—Excerpt from Crown Argenta's Speech at the Opening of the Vamorian Artificer College

Under Crown Argenta, Vamora entered an era of stability and renewal. Benefiting from the foundations laid by her father and grandfather, Argenta turned her reign toward the prosperity and advancement of her people.

One of her greatest achievements was the full integration of the Arcane Academy into Vamorian society. This partnership led to the local Academy branch's breakthrough in studying the continent's leylines, culminating in the discovery of Mana—a potent resource that revolutionized alchemy and metallurgy.

Argenta also sought to mend and strengthen ties with the elven houses of the Old Country. Notably, she permitted the return of House Starling to Vamora, reversing her grandfather's decree of exile. Seeking deeper unity, Argenta arranged the marriage of her younger son, Argentum, to a Starling heiress. Through this alliance, and in accordance with elven inheritance traditions, parts of the Starling estate returned to Vamorian hands—an outcome only possible because all Starling males had perished during the earlier purges.

Upon her retirement, Argenta passed the crown to her daughter, Niccola, elder sister of Argentum, ensuring the kingdom's line of succession remained strong.

## The Reign of Niccola, the Lost

>_As the sun sets, so do great lives pass from our world.<br>
>Lady of Light, receive your faithful daughter and son as the day yields to twilight.<br>
>May their journey be guided by your golden rays, and may their memory kindle hope in all who remain.<br>
>In darkness, we remember their warmth. In sorrow, we await the dawn._<br>
>—Blessing of the Setting Sun, Given during Niccola and her husband's funeral by the Headpriest of Bastion

Niccola’s reign, marked by her marriage to the Baron of Eastwoods, brought hope for unity across Vamora. That hope was soon overshadowed by disaster: the outbreak of the Red Plague. The deadly sickness swept the kingdom, sparing neither race nor rank. Humans, elves, and orcs suffered equally as the illness emptied villages and grief overtook every corner of the land.

When Niccola fell to the plague, the kingdom faced a leaderless crisis. In its darkest hour, Argenta returned from retirement to reclaim the crown and provide stability. Recognizing that Vamora needed strong and reliable governance in uncertain times, Argenta established the Crown’s Council—a new assembly of all the heads of state—so that no single hand would rule alone and the weight of leadership would be shared.

Argenta’s return brought brief order, but the Red Plague claimed her soon after. As suddenly as it had come, the plague vanished, leaving Vamora with unanswered questions and a kingdom shaped by sorrow.

## The Reign of Argentum, the Drunkerd

>_Oh, King Argentum liked his women and wine,<br>
>Left all the ruling to council and time.<br>
>When chaos came crashing, he slept through it all—<br>
>Splat goes the Drunkard in Bastion’s hall!_<br>
>—Old Tavern song.

When Argenta passed, the crown fell to Argentum, who ruled during a period of uneasy calm. The Red Plague vanished as mysteriously as it had arrived; many scholars speculated that its origin was planar, but no evidence remained. Argentum, known more for his indulgence than his governance, left the affairs of state largely in the hands of the Crown’s Council, preferring wine and revelry to the burdens of rule.

The Countess, his wife from House Starling, attempted to steer the council’s decisions, but her efforts only bred resentment and deepened the divide between the Crown and the states. Tensions grew as the council resisted her interference, weakening the unity Argenta had tried to foster.

During his reign, Argentum fathered a bastard son, Azargon, by a Starling elvish handmaiden. The child was never acknowledged by the Crown.

His rule came to a sudden and violent end with the eruption of the Times of Chaos. Elemental forces raged across the land, and a rampaging elemental devastated the original keep of Bastion, killing Argentum and bringing his troubled reign to a close.

## The Reign of Aurum II, the Halfking
>_Let this day be the proof that old wounds can heal, and that new roads can carry us beyond the grudges of the past. May every journey on these rails remind us that Vamora’s strength lies not in the walls we build, but in the bridges we cross—together. May we travel forward, not as strangers, but as partners in hope._<br>
>—Final words of Aurum II during his speech at the opening of the Highrock Lighting Rail station.

Aurum II ascended to the throne in a time of recovery, guiding Vamora out of turmoil with steady vision and the counsel of the realm’s leaders. Drawing on the cooperation fostered by the Crown and aided by his mother’s ties to the Academy, Aurum II united the states to drive back elemental chaos and eliminate the Darksun cult.

He chose stability over dynastic intrigue, recognizing his half-brother as head of House Starling and Hand of the Crown. To further unify Vamora, Aurum II established the Imperium—a centralized military force. Each state was required to send fifteen percent of its armies to serve directly under the Crown within the Imperium. This force allowed for rapid response to threats and brought the states under tighter royal control.

Aurum II’s reign was marked by innovation and rebuilding. The Academy and the Artificer College flourished, their research propelled by new elemental resources discovered in the wake of the Times of Chaos. Advancements in arcanotech—particularly in transportation, utilities, and manufacturing—benefited the crafter guilds, trading guilds, and the entire realm.

Though Aurum II reinforced the eastern borders against orcish raids, he avoided expansion into Orcish lands. When the Bloodriver raids erupted, the Imperium’s strength quickly quashed the incursion. Aurum II then secured a lasting peace by negotiating directly with orcish leaders, granting them the disputed Goldleaf lands—a decision that angered some in the Westfold but ended hostilities in the east.

In the twilight of his long, elven-blooded life, Aurum II strove for unity. At the inauguration of the first Lightning Rail station in orcish territory—a symbol of new partnership—the event turned deadly. The separatist Earthbound Clan, orchestrated a devastating implosion, ending Aurum II’s reign.

Aurum II is remembered as a builder and diplomat who brought progress and unity to Vamora, but whose vision was cut short by the persistent shadows of division and unrest.

## The Reign of Petraeus, the Usurper

>_“Though these are trying days, I am assured by certain quiet assemblies in the old halls that our season of trial nears its end. Should a different standard rise above the market in due course, I trust the Guild will recall where its future courtesies are best extended.”_<br>
>—From Azargon of House Starling's letter to the Vamorian Trading Guilds<br>
>Send during the last years of Petraeus' rule

After the death of Aurum II, Petraeus—a high-ranking military commander from Greyhawk—seized power in the confusion that followed. With support from the Imperium’s officers and promises of decisive order, he declared himself ruler, plunging Vamora into a new age of martial rule.

Petraeus governed with a heavy hand, centralizing authority, sidelining the Crown’s Council, and imposing strict surveillance throughout the realm. The Academy and Artificer College were placed firmly under state control, their discoveries redirected toward the machinery of war and control rather than progress or prosperity.

Determined to reassert dominance, Petraeus launched aggressive campaigns into Orcish lands. Yet, in a twist of fate, the Lightning Rail disaster served as a rallying cry for the orc tribes, who—for the first time since the age of the Third Voice—united as a confederation of clans. While Petraeus managed to reclaim the Goldleaf territories and push the borders further east than any Crown before him, his gains were short-lived. As casualties mounted and the costs spiraled, the council began to resist, refusing to fund a war that only brought grief and division. The war stagnated, and Petraeus was forced to withdraw, holding only the contested Goldleaf lands.

In the later years of his reign, Petraeus found himself increasingly isolated—opposed by the council, resented by the populace, and distrusted by all but his most ardent loyalists. His rule left Vamora weary and divided, setting the stage for the uprisings that would follow.
