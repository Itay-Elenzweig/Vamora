# Age of the Dark Sun
>_“When moonlight is all that’s left to guide us,<br>
>We hold the line and sing her name<br>
>Until dawn’s return and shadow’s flight,<br>
>Kaguya’s hope remains.”_<br>
>—Kaguya's Song, Songs of Lightless Vol. III

Long before the rise of nations or written history, the continent was ruled by the ancient Elven kingdoms. This age ended with the catastrophe known as the Dark Sun.
During this time, the sun vanished, and the balance of the world was broken. Orcish legions, driven by a mysterious force, surged from the Far Realms, burning forests and toppling Elven cities.

In the midst of this darkness, Princess Kaguya, the Moon-blessed daughter of Selûne, united the Elven peoples and led a legendary alliance to stand against the orcish invaders. Through her sacrifice, she defeated the Orcish warlord and ended the curse. The moon returned, and the sun was reborn as the goddess Solâna.

# Age of the Empire

> _“All banners bowed before the Empire. In unity, all differences faded—but even the brightest marble cracks when the heart beneath it grows hollow.”_ <br>
> — Excerpt from  the Diary of Lord Nimblefoot<br>
> Halfling Lord who joined the Empire during it's golden age.

After the darkness lifted, the Elven kingdoms united their wisdom and magic to found a continent-spanning empire. Guided by self-exceptionalism and their closeness to the divine, the Elves believed themselves destined to rule and perfect the world.

The Blood War with the orcs continued to smolder along the empire’s borders, a living reminder of old betrayals rooted in the Dark Sun. Though the empire pressed ever outward, these wounds never fully healed.

During this era, Elven explorers discovered scattered Human villages along the coasts—humble communities clinging to survival. The empire swiftly integrated these humans, often erasing their histories, languages, and customs in favor of a unified imperial identity under elven superiority.

As the Elven Empire expanded across the continent, it founded great cities and consolidated its power through knowledge and tradition. The prestigious Arcane Academy was established as the center for magical education and scholarship, training generations of mages, sages, and court advisors who would serve the empire’s rulers.

It was the Elves who first mapped and claimed Vamora, the fertile continent that would one day shape the world’s destiny. For centuries, Vamora flourished as elven imperial provinces, its culture and identity remade in the image of its Elven overseers.

The Age of the Empire ended with the death of the last Elven Emperor, who left no male heir. With the throne empty, the great houses of the Elves fell to rivalry and discord, and the unity of the empire began to unravel.

# Age of Vamora
## Before the Revolt
>_Great Spirits, <br>
>We thank you for the Third Gon-Vox who led us to these lands. <br>
>Guide us now as we wait For the Fourth, <br>
>Who will lead us to glory._ <br>
>—Vamorian Uruk Prayer

We listen for your call.
For centuries after its discovery, Vamora was claimed by the distant Elven Empire. Elven colonists, administrators, and soldiers from the Old Land established cities and estates across the coasts and heartlands, imposing Elven law and culture on all who dwelled in their domains. The Elves saw Vamora as a land of endless potential—a canvas upon which they could remake the world in their own image, far from the old wars and rivalries.

Yet not all peoples of Vamora bent to Elven rule. The Orcs, led by their Gon-Vox (“The Voice”)—a prophetic leader guided by the spirits—came to Vamora of their own accord, seeking new lands and new destinies. Following Sehzade Sultan Kulumar, son of Sultan Sulumar and leader of the Uruk, bands of orcish settlers journeyed across the sea, believing they answered a sacred calling. These Uruks and their followers established their own communities, living by their own customs and laws, ever watchful for the next Gon-Vox to guide their path.

Meanwhile, human and other non-elven populations within the Elven domains lived as subjects—often stripped of ancestral identities and shaped to fit the imperial ideal. Most toiled as laborers, servants, or farmers, with only a privileged few educated in elven ways.

Vamora, on the eve of revolution, was a continent of grand cities, distant estates, free orcish camps, and hidden tensions—orderly on the surface, yet alive with many voices and a longing for change.

## The Revolt under Aurum I, the Warrior

> _“To the kingdoms of the Old Land, <br>
> Let it be known that Vamora stands free and unbroken. <br>
> No longer shall our fate be written by distant hands or old arrogance. <br>
> We claim our own dawn—by right, by struggle, and by the will of those who would be ruled no more.”_ <br>
> —The Declaration of Bastion, by Aurum I, First Crown of Bastion

The peace of Elven rule in Vamora would not last forever. Discontent simmered among the human population—stripped of their heritage, burdened with labor, and denied power by imperial decree. In the shadows and among the fields, talk of resistance began to grow.

It was during this time that a human leader, Aurum I, emerged. Charismatic and resolute, Aurum united scattered bands of rebels, outlaws, and oppressed villagers into a single cause. He called for an end to Elven domination and the restoration of freedom and dignity to the peoples of Vamora.

As the human uprising ignited, the Orcs saw an opportunity. Seizing the moment, orcish warbands launched their own campaign and captured the Goldleaf territories east of what is now Bastion—lands that had long been the domain of the Elven House Goldleaf. Aurum I, forced to secure his flank, fought a bitter campaign against the orcs before turning his attention westward to capture the remaining Elven strongholds and consolidate his new realm.

The Elven Empire, weakened by internal rivalries and distant from its Old Land heart, could not contain the revolt. Battles raged from city to countryside as Elven power crumbled and new alliances were forged.

With victory came the founding of a new human-led kingdom. Aurum I was crowned the first Crown of Vamora, and the capital city of Bastion was raised as a symbol of unity and newfound strength.

## The Reign of Ferrum II, the Builder

> _“You have my gratitude for your steadfast service.<br>
> The roads and markets binding our kingdom are the fruit of your industry as much as royal vision. <br>
>As Vamora looks outward to new frontiers, I trust the Trading Company will remain our shield and standard-bearer.<br>
>Let our partnership endure, for in shared purpose lies our strength. <br>
>May fortune favor your banners.”_<br>
>—Excerpt from a Letter by Ferrum II, to the Directors of the Vamorian Trading Company

Following the turbulent victories of Aurum I, the newly forged Kingdom of Vamora entered an era of consolidation and challenge Ferrum II, Aurum’s first born, inherited a realm still scarred by conflict and uneasy peace.

Ferrum II sought to solidify human rule and bring order to the land, expanding infrastructure and strengthening the borders. His reign, however, was marked by persistent unrest. Tensions with the Orcish territories remained high, as old grievances from the wars lingered and new disputes over land and resources erupted. Ferrum II’s campaigns against the orcish enclaves in the east were fierce and costly, deepening the divide between the two peoples even as some efforts at negotiation were made.

Meanwhile, the Elven houses—diminished but not destroyed—attempted to reclaim influence in the new kingdom, sometimes as advisors, sometimes as conspirators. Ferrum II’s administration walked a fine line between integration and suspicion, wary of both elven intrigue and orcish reprisal.

Despite these challenges, Ferrum II presided over the rebuilding of Bastion and the beginnings of a new Vamorian identity. The seeds of unity and ambition were sown, though the old wounds of conquest and rebellion had yet to truly heal.

## The Reign of Argenta, the Prosperous

>_“Today, in the halls of Cerilia, we open more than doors to a college—we open a new chapter for all Vamora.<br>
> The discovery of mana marks not just a gift for scholars or mages, but a promise to every craftsman, farmer, and child in our land. Here, with our friends and kin from Eastwoods and beyond, let us shape wonders from wisdom, and forge a future that honors both tradition and invention. <br>
>May this place stand as proof that what unites us—craft, ingenuity, and the tireless work of many hands—will always outshine what divides us.”_ <br>
>—Excerpt from Crown Argenta’s Speech at the Opening of the Vamorian Artificer College

Under Crown Argenta, Vamora entered an era of stability and renewal. Benefiting from the foundations laid by her father and grandfather, Argenta turned her reign toward the prosperity and advancement of her people.

One of her greatest achievements was the full integration of the Arcane Academy into Vamorian society. This partnership led to the local Academy branch’s breakthrough in studying the continent’s leylines, culminating in the discovery of Mana—a potent resource that revolutionized alchemy and metallurgy.

Argenta also sought to mend and strengthen ties with the elven houses of the Old Country. Notably, she permitted the return of House Starling to Vamora, reversing her grandfather’s decree of exile. Seeking deeper unity, Argenta arranged the marriage of her younger son, Argentum, to a Starling heiress. Through this alliance, and in accordance with elven inheritance traditions, parts of the Starling estate returned to Vamorian hands—an outcome only possible because all Starling males had perished during the earlier purges.

Upon her retirement, Argenta passed the crown to her daughter, Niccola, elder sister of Argentum, ensuring the kingdom’s line of succession remained strong.
